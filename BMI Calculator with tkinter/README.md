This code creates a simple Tkinter GUI for calculating BMI. Users can enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms, and upon clicking the "Calculate BMI" button, the BMI and the corresponding category (Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, or Obese) will be displayed.

Make sure you have the Tkinter library installed on your system to run this code. You can run it in a Python environment, and a window with the BMI calculator will appear.
